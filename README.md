# personal-blog

## USER STORY

As a marketing student, I want a personal blog so that I can showcase my thoughts and experiences

## ACCEPTAANCE CRITERIA

Given a personal blog, there are a few things that I would like to occur:

- When I load the app, I should be presented with the landing page containing a form with labels and inputs for username, blog title and blog content.
- When I submit the form, then the blog post data should be stored to a localStorage.
- When the form is submitted, I should be redirected to the posts page.
- If I attempt to enter a form without a username, blog title OR blog content, a message should appear saying "Incomplete Form!'.
- Upon the posts page, the header should have an option for a light/dark toggle and the content of the page should be updated to reflect the selection.
- When I click the "Back" button, I should be redirected to the landing page where I can input more blog entries.
- When I view the main content, I should be presented with a lists of blog posts that are pulled from the localStorage.
- When viewing the localStorage, there should be a JSON array of blog post objects, each including the post author's username, title of the post and the post's content.
- When taking a closer look at a single blog entry in the list, I should be able to see the title and the author of the post.
- When I view the footer, then I am presented with the developer's portfolio.
